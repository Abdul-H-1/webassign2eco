            <h3><b> Introduction </b></h3> <br>
            <p> The environmental degradation caused by human activities has increased during this last century beyond what the Earth system can sustain. Climate change, ocean eutrophication, and biodiversity loss are some examples of the factors that have exceeded natural boundaries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><b> History</b> </h3><br>
            <p> Green cars, green cleaners, green plywood. Today there are eco-friendly alternatives in virtually every product category. Consumer interest in green products continues to rise as more products are introduced each year. It becomes increasingly more difficult to imagine a time when climate change and sustainability weren’t a concern. In less than a generation we’ve gone from giving little consideration to sustainability to it becoming part of most people’s daily lives.

              With all the information coming at us every day, it’s often hard to get perspective. In this series focusing on the history of green brands and marketing, I’m hoping to provide that perspective–to give context to where we are with green marketing, how we got here, and where green marketing is possibly headed.</p>
